|3|Aqua|[The Ticking Supply Chain Attack Bomb of Exposed Kubernetes Secrets](https://blog.aquasec.com/the-ticking-supply-chain-attack-bomb-of-exposed-kubernetes-secrets)|Blog post explaining the critical threat of exposed Kubernetes secrets and how researchers from Aqua Nautilus discovered and analyzed hundreds of them in public GitHub repositories. The researchers focused on two types of secrets: dockercfg and dockerconfigjson, which store credentials for access to external registries. They used the GitHub API to search for and retrieve these secrets, and performed complex regular expressions to filter out plaintext passwords and tokens. They found 438 records that potentially held valid credentials, of which 203 contained valid credentials for private container images hosted on various registries, such as Red Hat, Quay, Docker Hub, and SAP Artifacts. These credentials allowed for pulling and pushing privileges, and in some cases, full access to the registries. The researchers reported these issues to the relevant stakeholders and helped them secure their registries. They also demonstrated that most secrets scanners failed to detect these encoded secrets, and suggested the need for open-source tools and secret scanners that can include encoded secrets in their detection capabilities. They emphasized the profound implications of these findings for individual developers and large organizations, as they could expose sensitive data, compromise security, and enable supply chain attacks.| #kubernetes #kubernetessecrets #supplychainattack|

Hunters International’s ransomware code is similar to Hive’s, but with some simplifications and modifications, such as using Rust language, embedding the key within the encrypted file, and reducing the command-line arguments. Some mitigation strategies are provided, as well as additional steps to be taken to reduce the risk of data exfiltration.| #Hive #HuntersInternational #ransomware #dataexfiltration #ransomwareasaservice #unitedstates #USA #US #unitedkingdom #uk #germany #namibia|
|7|Blackwing Intelligence|[A Touch of Pwn - Part I)](https://blackwinghq.com/blog/posts/a-touch-of-pwn-part-i/)|Blog post by Blackwing Intelligence summarising their research on Windows Hello fingerprint authentication, a biometric technology that allows users to log in to their devices with their fingerprints. The authors were hired by Microsoft’s Offensive Research and Security Engineering (MORSE) group to evaluate the security of the top three fingerprint sensors embedded in laptops and used for Windows Hello. The sensors were from Goodix, Synaptics, and ELAN, and were embedded in Dell, Lenovo, and Microsoft laptops respectively. The authors aimed to find vulnerabilities that would allow them to bypass Windows Hello authentication on these devices, and describe their vulnerability research process and the exploits they developed for each target device. They reveal multiple logical and cryptographic flaws in the implementation of SDCP and the custom protocols used by the sensors. They also demonstrate how they were able to enroll rogue fingerprints, spoof valid IDs, and intercept and rewrite USB packets to bypass Windows Hello authentication. They also discuss the challenges and limitations of existing USB man-in-the-middle tools and how they developed their own solutions using Raspberry Pi and USB armory. The authors conclude that they were able to achieve full bypass of Windows Hello authentication on all three target devices in three months. They recommend that vendors of biometric authentication solutions enable SDCP, have their implementation audited by qualified experts, and consider the broader attack surface of their devices. They also suggest some future research directions, such as firmware security, hidden functionality, direct hardware attacks, and side channel attacks.|              #cryptography #exploitdevelopment #Exploits #Postgresql #RCE #reverseengineering #vulnerabilityresearch|

Scattered Spider actors use various social engineering techniques, such as phishing, push bombing, and SIM swap attacks, to obtain credentials, install remote access tools, and/or bypass MFA. They also register their own MFA tokens after compromising a user’s account to establish persistence. Scattered Spider actors engage in data theft for extortion and have also been known to use BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware alongside their usual TTPs. They encrypt data using a 4096-bit RSA key with a ChaCha20 algorithm and append a .blackcat extension to encrypted files. They drop a PDF ransom note named “CriticalBreachDetected” and demand ransom payments in Bitcoin. The report recommends several mitigations to reduce the likelihood and impact of a cyberattack by Scattered Spider actors, such as maintaining offline backups, enabling phishing-resistant MFA, implementing application controls, and segmenting networks. The document also urges organizations to report any suspicious or criminal activity related to Scattered Spider to the FBI, CISA, or the MS-ISAC.| #ScatteredSpider #socialengineering #BlackCat #ALPHV #malware #ransomware #aptgroups |

The hackers wanted to be discovered and did not cause any physical damage. The incident is being investigated by the state police, the FBI and CISA. The PLC that was hacked is a Unitronics V570, which is used by many critical infrastructure systems, not just water utilities. A Shodan search shows more than 2,200 Unitronics systems in the U.S. and worldwide. The hack raises the question of who else has been hacked or will be attacked by the same group or others. The hack exposes the lack of focus, training and information sharing on control system cyber incidents3. It also shows the need for minimum cybersecurity best practices and regulations in the water sector. The author suggests a public-private collaboration model to advance cybersecurity in the water sector and prevent future attacks. The hack is not only a domestic issue, but also an international one, as the hackers have targeted Israeli water and energy sites before. The author also warns about the media providing too much information about the equipment and systems that could be used by adversaries.| #OTSecurity #iran #US #USA #unitedstates #industry_water #israel |

The manufacturing sector was the most impacted industry, followed by the ICS equipment and engineering sector. The transportation, oil and gas, electric, mining, renewable energy, defense, and water sectors also experienced ransomware incidents. 3) Some ransomware groups appeared to target specific industries and regions, such as Moneymessage targeting the defense sector and Rancoz and Akira targeting the U.S. Dragos observed 30 active ransomware groups out of 72 that have historically attacked industrial organizations. Cl0p, Lockbit 3.0, 8base, Play, and Cactus were the most used ransomware variants, and 4) Dragos assesses that ransomware will remain a major threat to industrial organizations in Q4 2023 and beyond, and that ransomware groups will likely prioritize zero-day vulnerabilities in their operations. Dragos also expects new ransomware variants to emerge and existing ones to evolve.| #quarterlyreport #OTSecurity #Lockbit #Cl0p #US #USA #unitedstates #industry_manufacturing #industry_transportation #industry_oilandgas #industry_electric #industry_mining #industry_energy #industry_defense #industry_water #ransomware #8Base #Play #Cactus #zeroday |
|24|Elastic|[Elastic catches DPRK passing out KANDYKORN](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/elastic-catches-dprk-passing-out-kandykorn)|Elastic Security Labs reveals a novel intrusion targeting blockchain engineers of a crypto exchange platform by DPRK and Lazarus Group actors, leveraging a combination of custom and open source capabilities for initial access and post-exploitation. Researchers discovered this intrusion when analyzing attempts to reflectively load a binary into memory on a macOS endpoint. The intrusion set was traced to a Python application posing as a cryptocurrency arbitrage bot delivered via a direct message on a public Discord server. The attacker social-engineered their initial victim into downloading and decompressing the malicious file, which initiated a multi-stage malware execution flow involving SUGARLOADER, KANDYKORN, and HLOADER. SUGARLOADER connects to a Command and Control server and downloads a final stage payload (KANDYKORN) from it, using reflective binary loading to execute it directly in memory. KANDYKORN has a full-featured set of capabilities to access and exfiltrate data from the victim’s computer, and waits for commands from the server instead of polling for them, reducing the number of endpoint and network artifacts. The researchers provide additional information about the network infrastructure, code-signing certificates, and custom Lazarus Group detection rules that track this intrusion set as REF7001.| #northkorea #LazarusGroup #AppleMacOS #socialengineering #SugarLoader #KandyKorn #HLoader |

LIMITED](https://medium.com/@joshuapenny88/hostinghunter-series-chang-way-technologies-co-limited-a9ba4fce0f65)|HostingHunter is a series of blogs where Joshua Penny explores various hosting providers on the internet to uncover malicious or interesting activity conducted on them. The author starts with little knowledge and uses different tools and techniques to find out more. The first hosting provider that the author investigates is "Chang Way Technologies", a company registered in Hong Kong that has an ASN with over 3,000 IPv4 addresses. The author finds connections between the company and a persona named “processor” who sells bulletproof hosting services called “UNDERGROUND” and "BearHost".  The author documents some of the findings on the hosting provider, such as: 1) a server that receives credentials from compromised Citrix VPN gateways using a webshell exploit, 2) a phishing page that impersonates the National Crime Records Bureau of India and demands payment from victims, 3) several servers that host C2s for malware such as Hydra, Hookbot, aXedroid, Rusty droid, and BlackByte ransomware, 4) some servers that run tools such as Nessus, Metasploit, and Cobalt Strike, possibly for penetration testing or malicious purposes, 5) some servers that are part of the 404 TDS, a traffic distribution system that delivers different malware to victims based on criteria, and 6) a server that runs Tactical RMM, a remote monitoring and management tool that can be abused by threat actors for persistent access. The author concludes that Chang Way is a hosting provider that hosts a lot of criminal activities and has some interesting connections to bulletproof hosting services.|#phishing #C2 #malware #ransomware #bulletproofhosting |

The authors used various tools and techniques in their analysis to identify and cluster the IP addresses, domains and files associated with the first table of IOCs. They found connections to Chang Way Technologies, a hosting provider linked to malicious activity, and Covenant, a .NET command and control framework. They also found a TeamViewer IP address that shared a SSH banner hash with many other servers hosting different malware and services. The authors focused on two IP addresses that shared a SSH hash with a group they called ShadowSyndicate, which they had previously reported on. They found that these IP addresses were running OpenVPN servers and were linked to LockBit ransomware. They also found connections to other ransomware groups, such as 8Base and Avaddon, and a data leak site hosted on one of the IPs. The authors conclude that their analysis reveals a plethora of findings and connections to other ransomware groups, malware and infrastructure from the IOCs provided by Boeing, and they recommend that these indicators should be treated as malicious and validated before taking any action.| #Lockbit #ransomware #malware #ShadowSyndicate #8Base #Avaddon|

This blog is an analysis of the Red Cross’ rules of engagement for hacktivists and the obligations of states to observe them. The Red Cross proposes the eight rules for civilian hackers who participate in cyber operations during wars, based on international humanitarian law; the rules aim to protect civilians and civilian objects from harm, and to prevent hacktivists from becoming targets or violators of the law themselves. The Red Cross also suggests four obligations for states to restrain hacktivists on their territory or under their control, based on the UN Group of Governmental Experts’ recommendations. The obligations include not using proxies, not encouraging violations, preventing and prosecuting war crimes, and suppressing other violations. The analysis mentions the case of KillNet, a pro-Russia hacktivist group involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which claimed to comply with the Red Cross’ rules after initially rejecting them. However the analysis shows that KillNet continued to target civilian objects, such as banks, airports, and Israeli websites, after its announcement. The analysis assesses that KillNet’s declarations were likely a publicity stunt and that states will probably continue to sponsor hacktivist groups for their own interests.| #KillNet #aptgroups #threatactor #hactivist #rulesofengagement #russia #ukraine |  
|61|Recorded Future, Insikt Group|[Charting China’s Climb as a Leading Cyber Power](https://www.recordedfuture.com/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power)|Report on the evolution of Chinese cyber-espionage activity. The Insikt group states that Chinese cyber operations have evolved into a more mature and coordinated threat, exploiting both known and zero-day vulnerabilities in public-facing security and network appliances, having improved their operational security and anonymity, making detection harder, while shifting from broad intellectual property theft to a more targeted approach supporting specific strategic, economic, and geopolitical goals. Insikt states that a vulnerability-centric defense approach is inadequate - instead organisations, governments, and the cybersecurity community need better defensive in-depth measures to detect post-exploitation activities. China is likely to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in cloud services as well, and is poised to become a dominant global force in cyber espionage and information warfare. China’s cyber capabilities are influenced by both internal and external factors, such as military restructuring, domestic regulations, and reporting by Western governments and the cybersecurity community. China’s cyber activities support its efforts to project power in the South China Sea and Taiwan, and prepare for potential future actions.

This platform can proxy the requests between the victim and Microsoft and take over the victim’s account, even if MFA is enabled. The company was skeptical about the phishing mail and did not fall for it. They shared their findings on their blog to raise awareness about this type of attack and how to protect against it.| #Storm-1575 #phishing #netherlands #thenetherlands #holland #qrcode #qrcodephishing #phishingasaservice |
