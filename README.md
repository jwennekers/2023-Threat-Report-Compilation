# Welcome to the 2023 Threat Report Compilation!

![Threat Report Compilation](https://github.com/jwennekers/2023-Threat-Report-Compilation/assets/136587455/7caa5bdc-11f3-4fff-8449-3fe7b2c9d9db)


Trends: Every year there are shifts in the cyber threat landscape, changes in attack techniques, and the number of breaches. And each year vendors, security organisations, research institutes and government agencies publish relevant reports on the current cybersecurity threat landscape. As the number of various published reports can be daunting, I‚Äôve tried (like in [2022](https://medium.com/@j-wennekers/2022-a-selection-of-annual-cybersecurity-threat-reports-aec9166265c0)) to create an overview of a selection of what has been published so far in 2023 ‚Äî and, more importantly, where to get them. The selection is shown in alphabetical order based on the publishing organisation.

> _üí° This overview will be updated throughout the year with newly released reports and insights. Do you have any additions? Feel free to message me and I'll make sure they're added to the overview!_

# Tips for reading the reports efficiently
First and foremost, remember that none of the reports should be seen as a single source of truth ‚Äî as much as some publishers might want you to. In some cases, data might be complementary or contradictory, depending on the scope of the data collected (e.g. due to differences in client base, research participants, or the way technical data is collected). Because of this, always keep a critical mind while reading.

Secondly, be aware of the period over which the publishing organisation is reporting. E.g. a ‚Äú2022‚Äù report could be released in 2023. If you intend to create a [personal knowledgebase](https://medium.com/@j-wennekers/starting-up-your-second-brain-how-to-start-with-personal-knowledge-management-d5a922ad781a) with reports or whitepapers from multiple years, this is an important distinction to keep in mind.

Thirdly, focus on the parts of the reports that are relevant to your (client) organisation. This could for example be parts that focus on

* your industry,
* geographical location, or
* cloud infrastructure that your (client) organisation leverages

And lastly, keep in mind why you‚Äôre reading the report ‚Äî a SOC Analyst requires different information from a threat report to fulfil their job than their CISO, and will thus always look at the data with a different view.
